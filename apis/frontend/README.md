# Illumino Frontend-API

This is the API responsible for serving the whole frontend with data. This means that both the progressive web app, the admin site as well as the native app will use this microservice.

The API is not complete though, and it requires the `auth`Â API for authentication via the `/login` and `/logout` endpoints. Please visit the `README` in `apis/auth` for detailed documentation on their intended usage.
